## 🔧 API Integration

### Backend Requirements
The admin dashboard expects these API endpoints:

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Admin authentication
- `GET /api/health` - Server health check

#### Admin Endpoints (require Bearer token)
- `GET /api/admin/users/metrics` - User analytics data
- `GET /api/admin/users` - User listing with pagination
- `GET /api/admin/charts/user-types` - Chart data for user distribution
- `GET /api/admin/charts/activity` - Daily activity trends
- `GET /api/admin/charts/game-actions` - Game action breakdowns
- `GET /api/admin/performance` - Server performance metrics

### Data Formats
All API responses follow consistent JSON structure with:
- User type categorization (guest vs registered)
- Chart.js compatible data formats
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Real-time metrics with timestamps
