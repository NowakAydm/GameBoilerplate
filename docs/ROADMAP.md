## Phase 2: WebSocket ✅ COMPLETED

- **User connects with JWT**
- **Game emits actions**
- **Server broadcasts updates or errors** (for anti-cheat)
- Optionally add game events (combat, item drop)

**📖 [View Phase 2 Implementation Guide](./PHASE2_README.md)**

---

## Phase 3: Authentication & Anti-Cheat ✅ COMPLETED

### 👤 Auth System

- ✅ Guest users → temp JWT, no DB entry
- ✅ Registered users → JWT + MongoDB storage
- ✅ Admins → special role in JWT

### 🛡️ Anti-Cheat Middleware

- ✅ On gameAction WebSocket/event:
  - ✅ Validate request using server-side game rules
  - ✅ Reject illegal actions (e.g., teleport, infinite gold)

**Implementation Details:**

- Complete JWT authentication system with bcrypt password hashing
- MongoDB user management with guest/registered/admin roles
- Server-side game state management and validation
- Rate limiting and movement validation
- Full WebSocket integration with auth middleware
- Client-side auth store with Zustand
- Admin API endpoints for game management

- ✅ **Logs viewer:**
  - ✅ Socket logs, game events, errors with categorization
  - ✅ Filtering by type and level
  - ✅ Search functionality with expandable details
  - ✅ Pagination for large log sets
- ✅ **Game data editor:**

  - ✅ `tick()` function in frontend tied to animation loop
  - ✅ Server-side simulation with configurable tick rates
  - ✅ Delta time management and FPS monitoring
  - ✅ Performance profiling and statistics
- ✅ **Action System:**
  - ✅ Define actions like move, attack, use_item with schemas
  - ✅ Validate actions in backend with Zod schemas
  - ✅ Send actions through WebSocket with cooldown management
  - ✅ Extensible action framework with custom validators
- ✅ **System Architecture:**
  - ✅ Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern
  - ✅ Pluggable systems (Movement, Combat, Physics, Inventory)
  - ✅ System priority ordering and enable/disable functionality
  - ✅ Game type presets (RPG, Shooter, Platformer, Puzzle)
- ✅ **Scene Management:**

## Phase 6: Mobile Optimization

- Use react-three-fiber's performance optimizations
  - Use drei helpers
  - Limit draw calls, geometry complexity
- Mobile touch controls (e.g., joystick, gestures)
- Progressive loading for assets
- PWA setup (optional)
- Viewport scaling and responsiveness

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- All game logic validated server-side
- Rate-limiting & IP monitoring
- Avoid client-trust for anything beyond visuals
- WebSocket auth with JWT refresh
- Action audit log for suspicious patterns
