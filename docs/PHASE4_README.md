```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Statistics
- `GET /admin/stats` - Server statistics
- `POST /admin/cleanup` - Cleanup inactive states

### Game Management
- `GET /admin/game-states` - Active game states
- `POST /admin/kick/:userId` - Kick specific user
- `PUT /admin/game-state/:userId` - Update game state

### Logging
- `GET /admin/logs` - System logs with filtering
  - Query params: `page`, `limit`, `type`, `level`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd packages/admin
npm install @mui/icons-material @mui/x-charts
```

### 2. Create Admin User
Use the existing auth system to create a user with `role: 'admin'`:
```bash
# Use the client or server to register a user, then manually update their role in MongoDB
```

### 3. Start the Admin Dashboard
```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev:admin
```

### 4. Access the Dashboard
Navigate to `http://localhost:5174` and login with admin credentials.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
The admin dashboard uses the same environment configuration as the client:
- `VITE_API_URL` - Server API base URL (defaults to http://localhost:3001)

### Server Configuration
Admin routes are automatically included when the server starts. The admin routes:
- Require JWT authentication
- Require admin role
- Track connections and log activities
- Provide real-time data

## 📊 Monitoring Features

### Real-time Updates
- Dashboard stats refresh every 5 seconds
- Game states refresh every 10 seconds
- Logs refresh every 5 seconds
- Charts update based on latest data

### Data Tracking
- Active WebSocket connections
- User authentication events
- Game actions and anti-cheat validations
- System errors and warnings

### Administrative Actions
- Kick users from active sessions
- Cleanup inactive game states
- View detailed error logs
- Monitor server performance

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Admin routes protected by JWT middleware
- Role verification on every request
- No sensitive data exposed to non-admin users

### Data Privacy
- User IDs displayed with truncation for privacy
- Sensitive user data not exposed in logs
- Admin actions are logged for audit trail

## 🎮 Integration with Game

### WebSocket Integration
The admin system integrates with existing WebSocket infrastructure:
- Tracks connections/disconnections
- Monitors game actions for anti-cheat
- Logs authentication events

### Game State Management
- Integrates with existing AntiCheatService
- Provides debugging tools for game states
- Allows manual intervention when needed

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Real-time WebSocket dashboard updates
- More detailed analytics and reporting
- User ban/suspension management
- Server performance metrics
- Database query monitoring
- Custom alert thresholds
- Export functionality for logs
- Advanced filtering and search

### Scalability Considerations
- Move from in-memory storage to Redis for multi-instance deployments
- Implement proper log aggregation service
- Add database connection pooling monitoring
- Implement rate limiting for admin endpoints

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Login fails**: Ensure user has `role: 'admin'` in database
2. **No data showing**: Check server is running and endpoints are accessible
3. **Connection errors**: Verify CORS settings and API URL configuration
4. **Charts not loading**: Ensure chart.js dependencies are installed

### Development Tips
- Use browser dev tools to monitor network requests
- Check server logs for authentication issues
- Verify JWT token format and expiration
- Test with sample admin user account
